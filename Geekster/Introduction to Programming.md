# Introduction to Programming

### What is Programming? 

**Programming** is the act of instructing computers to carry out tasks. It is often referred to as **coding**. A computer program is a sequence of instructions that the computer executes.

### The Natural Language of the Computer 
Computers do not understand the human language. The natural language of computers is the **binary** code — 1 and 0. These represent two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**.It is difficult for humans to communicate with computer in binary.

### Programming Languages
Generally, we communicate with computer in a language that's closer to our own natural language. These are more structured and should be thoroughly learned. The computer needs a way to understand our human language. To do this, we’ll need a **translator**.

1. **Algorithm** - Step by step instructions to solve a problem
2. **Syntax** - set of rules
3. **Key words** - reserved words which have special meaning
4. **Comments** - notes for programmers
5. **Variables** - used to store information, so that we can reuse it
6. **Data Types** - type of data
