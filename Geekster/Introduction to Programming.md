# Introduction to Programming

### What is Programming? 

Before we understand what programming is let's first see what **computers** are!

Computers are everywhere - they are in people's pockets (phones), in their cars, on their wrists (smart watches), and also might be in their backpacks. 
As humans we have always built tools that help us solve problems - like hammer, printing press, tractors. All these inventions helped us with **manual work**. Later people started wondering, "can we design a machine which can help us with **thinking work**?" - like solving equations, tracking stars in the sky. Rather than moving or manipulating physical things, like dit or stone, these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information. While designing the thinking machines, the pioneers realised that it should do 4 imortant tasks - Take **input**, **store** information, **process** it, and **output** it. These things are common to all computers and that's what makes a computer a computer!

**Programming** is the act of instructing computers to carry out tasks. It is often referred to as **coding**.

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that the computer executes.

### The Natural Language of the Computer 
Computers do not understand the human language. The natural language of computers is the **binary** code — 1 and 0. These represent two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**.It is difficult for humans to communicate with computer in binary.

### Programming Languages
Generally, we communicate with computer in a language that's closer to our own natural language. These are more structured and should be thoroughly learned. The computer needs a way to understand our human language. To do this, we’ll need a **translator**.

### Key Concepts
1. **Algorithm** - Step by step instructions to solve a problem
2. **Syntax** - set of rules
3. **Key words** - reserved words which have special meaning
4. **Comments** - notes for programmers
5. **Variables** - used to store information, so that we can reuse it
6. **Data Types** - type of data
