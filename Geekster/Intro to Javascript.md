# Intro to Javascript

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language created for the web. Back in 1995, when Brendan Eich created JavaScript, it was created to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites. For, example when I press like button for any post in facebook, the color of the hand changes to blue.That is possible because of JavaScript.
But today, JavaScript is used for all sorts of applications like programming a robot with arduino, writing games in unity, and even my favorite code editor(Visual Studio Code) is built using JavaScript.

**History of JavaScript**: Created in just 10 days. It is originally called LiveScript, but changed back to JavaScript as a marketing decision in order to ride on the top of popularity of Java at that time. Now, it is widely called as ECMAScript.
